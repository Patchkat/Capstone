## Learning
My initial work with neural networks for this project revolved around my learning, rather than going straight into working on my project. I followed the first few video of the [fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1) on practical deep learning for coders.  The first video just covers the basics of making a convolutional neural network that can detect cat and dog breeds out of a list of 36 different breeds.  While it isn't completely accurate, a lot of the mistakes that it makes are on breeds that there is even some debate about the difference amongst people.  The second lesson starts to dive a bit deeper, and focuses much more on the actual creation of a dataset, and then a model based on that dataset.  I thought that this would be quite useful, however it turned out that there is actually  [a dataset created by State Farm](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection) specifically revolving around detecting distracted driving.
