In these modern times, it is important for drivers to learn the dangers of the road and train themselves to be attentive. Teenagers and adults alike are more susceptible to being distracted now due to driver assist features that are automating many actions.  Drivers are now also more stressed and tired.

##Being attentive
Attentiveness is the single most important attribute a driver can possess.  Things such as car control and road-rule knowledge are unimportant if a driver is not being attentive.  When a driver is not paying attention, it is impossible to make a decision about proper evasive maneuvering, as they don't even realize it is necessary. Being attentive is an active choice that all drivers must make.  Distractions will occur, but you must choose to push them away and stay focused on the road ahead.

## Common distractions
  •	Texting
  •	Talking on the phone
  •	Map reading
  •	Eating and Drinking
  •	Navigating with a GPS

##Attentive habits
Habits of being an attentive driver need to be formed when someone first begins driving.  If they begin later, then it is much harder. Bad habits may have already been developed, so they must be retrained to remove the bad habits and replace them with proper attentive driving.

##[Statistics](https://www.epermittest.com/drivers-education/risks-distracted-driving#the-impact-of-distracted-driving)
In 2016, 3,450 people were killed in accidents involving at least one distracted driver.  In 2015, 391,000 people were injured in accidents that involved distracted driving.  Many accidents are likely not accounted for in these numbers, as it is impossible to tell in some cases.  However, these numbers clearly indicate that distracted driving is a major issue in our modern society.  The National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted a study where they tracked the actions of drivers behind the wheel.  In 23% of tracked crashes or near-collisions, distracted driving was the main cause.  So which actions are the worst offenders?  Well, the riskiest distractions are often not the ones that cause crashes.  Due to the risk, they are rarely done, and drivers generally try to get back to focusing on the road as quickly as possible.  However, more common and simple distractions do often cause crashes.  A driver becomes more accustomed to a simple distraction, and is less cautious about making sure they pay attention to the road, often resulting in a crash.  The NHTSA also found that:
  •	14 out of every million licensed drivers involved in fatal distracted driving crashes.
  •	24 out of every million teenage licensed drivers involved in fatal distracted driving crashes.
  •	Of 3,154 distracted driving fatalities in 2013, 8 percent were teenagers between 15 and 19 years old.
  •	10 percent of all teenagers killed on the road died in distracted driving crashes.
  •	10 percent of all drivers responsible for distracted driving deaths were teenagers.

##Teenagers
Teenagers are almost two times as likely to be involved in a distracted driving collision.  They are less likely to realize the risk involved with distracted driving, and are not accustomed to the amount of attention that driving requires.  This unfortunate mix results in many more teens being in accidents, especially related to distracted driving.
