## Welcome to My Capstone

My basic project was creating a neural network that was capable of detecting whether or not a driver is paying attention while driving, and then attempt to get them to start paying attention again.

### Background

I started with some research into what causes distracted driving, and what distracted driving can cause.

1. Accidents caused by distracted driving
2. How to prvent it

### Training

Spent a long time training. Took 24 hours in fact. Couldn't get it to save. Still figuring that one out.

### Results

It could work.  Can't get it to take in images.
