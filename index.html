<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome!</h1>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">This is the home page for my capstone blog.  Below, you will find some basic information about my project.</h4>

<p>The idea for my capstone was to use machine learning to detect whether a driver is paying attention or not. 
I spent the first few weeks doing research into both distracted driving and machine learning.  As the final few weeks approached, 
I swapped to focusing entirely on creating, training, and using my model to accurately tell whether  a driver was paying attention or not.  
For a basic introduction to distracted driving, check out the “Introduction” page at the top, and to learn more about my process for creating 
the neural network, check out “Neural Network”.  I hope you enjoy, and thanks for checking out my blog!</p>
