## Many accidents occur everyday, but how many are the result of distracted driving?

In 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted a study about distracted driving. They used data collected from all 50 states about distracted driving accidents from sources including the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) General Estimates System (GES).  All of this data combined provided a fairly comprehensive list of all crashes reported in the United States.

They found that there were 30,057 total fatal crashes involving 44,574 drivers in the US.  This resulted in a total 32,719 deaths. Of those fatal crashes, about 10% (2,910) involved distracted drivers, with some including multiple distracted drivers for a total of 2,959 distracted driver deaths.  This also resulted in a total of 3,154 fatalities (10% of total crash fatalities) from distracted driving. In non-fatal accidents or near collisions, it was found that almost 23% of them involved one or more distracted drivers. It was also found that about 14% (411) of all distracted driving fatalities were due to texting on a cell phone. 

[In 2015](www.epermittest.com/drivers-education/risks-distracted-driving#the-impact-of-distracted-driving.), 391,000 people were injured in distracted driving accidents.  In 2016, 3,450 people were killed in accidents that involved at least one distracted driver.  While it is only a small increase over 2013, an upward trend in distracted driving accidents is not a good thing.  It shows that people are starting to rely more and more on technology while driving.  [In 2018](www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving.), the NHTSA reported that 36,570 people died in automobile accidents, with another 400,000 being injured in collisions due to distracted driving.

For all fatal crashes in the NHTSA study, only around six percent of the drivers were 15 to 19 years old. However, for distracted drivers in fatal crashes, 10% of the distracted drivers were 15 to 19 years old. And 11% of all the distracted drivers using cell phones were 15 to 19 years old.  This was likely because teenagers are generally less likely to realize the risk involved with distracted driving, as driving requires more attention than they realize.  As they also have very little experience driving, the amount of attention required to drive safely is increased even more, resulting in a higher percentage of crashes caused by teenage drivers as opposed to drivers with more experience.

The 2013 NHTSA study found that 14 out of every million licensed drivers involved in fatal distracted driving crashes were teenagers.  When looking at specifically teenagers, it was found that 24 out of every million teenage licensed drivers were involved in fatal distracted driving crashes. Out of all of the 3,154 distracted driving fatalities in 2013, 8 percent were teenagers between 15 and 19 years old, quite a large percentage for such a small group of drivers. Overall, 10 percent of all teenagers killed on the road died in distracted driving crashes, and 10 percent of all drivers responsible for distracted driving deaths were teenagers. 

This data shows a clear issue with how people are taught to drive.  While I am not certain, I would say that it likely falls apart at a fairly young age. If someone grows up with a parent that has poor driving habits, the child will likely adopt many of these habits when they start driving. In order to prevent this, something like the device that I will make for my capstone is necessary.  Requiring experienced drivers to also get their licensed renewed more often would also likely cause them to avoid distracted driving a bit more, making driving safer for everyone.
