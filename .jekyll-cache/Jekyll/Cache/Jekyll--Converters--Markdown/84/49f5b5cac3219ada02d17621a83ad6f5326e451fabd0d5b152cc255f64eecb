<hr />
<p>Failing to complete this important task can result in serious injury or even death for the driver and any passengers.  In the short moment that you may look away from the road, another vehicle can pull out in front of you, or a pedestrian can intersect with your path.  Distracted driving causes the greatest increase in risk while driving, so avoiding it is of utmost importance.</p>
