<p>Failing to complete this task can result in serious injury or even death for the driver and any passengers.  In the short moment that you may look away from the road, another vehicle can pull out in front of you, or a pedestrian can intersect with your path.  Distracted driving causes the greatest increase in risk while driving, so avoiding it is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>For young drivers, it is especially important now to understand the dangers of distracted driving.  This allows them to train themselves to remain attentive while behind the wheel.  It is much easier to become distracted now than in the past, as modern vehicles possess many driver automation features that require less driver engagement, which allows them to become distracted much more easily.  Modern drivers are also a lot busier, more tired and stressed than drivers in the past.  All of this leads to the perfect conditions for distracted driving.</p>

<p>Any activity that does not directly relate to driving can be considered a distraction. It does not matter how important you believe the task to be, it is not as important as driving and paying attention the road ahead of and around you.  Splitting your attention between driving and some other task greatly increases your chance of being in an accident.</p>

<p>Control of a vehicle and knowledge of road rules are useless when distracted driving.  It does not matter if you are a racecar driver, if you are not paying attention there isnâ€™t time to take evasive action in the event of an accident.  Even if you return your attention to the road with enough time to react, choices that may be good in one situation will make another situation worse, and there is no way for you to take in the full scene around you while making a decision before colliding with another vehicle or pedestrian.</p>

<p>Being attentive is a choice that drivers must actively make.  Distractions will occur while driving, and you as the driver must choose to push away the distractions and stay focused on the road.  Some of the most common distractions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Texting</li>
  <li>Talking on the phone</li>
  <li>Other devices</li>
  <li>Listening to music</li>
  <li>Map reading</li>
  <li>Eating</li>
  <li>Drinking</li>
</ul>

<p>Forming attentive habits early on in a drivers experience is extremely important.  When a teenager or young adult first starts driving, if they develop poor habits, they will be much harder to change later in life.  Many people have already developed these poor habits, and my capstone project looks to help both new and old drivers stay attentive while driving.</p>
