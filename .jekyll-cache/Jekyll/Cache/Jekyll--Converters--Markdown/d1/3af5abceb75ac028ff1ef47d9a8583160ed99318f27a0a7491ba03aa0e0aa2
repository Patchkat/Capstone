<h1 id="nhtsa">NHTSA</h1>

<p>In 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted a study about distracted driving. They used data collected from all 50 states about distracted driving accidents from sources including the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) General Estimates System (GES).  All of this data combined provided a fairly comprehensive list of all crashes reported in the United States.</p>

<p>They found that there were 30,057 total fatal crashes involving 44,574 drivers in the US.  This resulted in a total 32,719 deaths. Of those fatal crashes, about 10% (2,910) involved distracted drivers, with some including multiple distracted drivers for a total of 2,959 distracted driver deaths.  This also resulted in a total of 3,154 fatalities (10% of total crash fatalities) from distracted driving. In non-fatal accidents or near collisions, it was found that almost 23% of them involved one or more distracted drivers. It was also found that about 14% (411) of all distracted driving fatalities were due to texting on a cell phone.</p>

<p>In 2015, 391,000 people were injured in distracted driving accidents.  In 2016, 3,450 people were killed in accidents that involved at least one distracted driver.  While it is only a small increase over 2013, an upward trend in distracted driving accidents is not a good thing.  It shows that people are starting to rely more and more on technology while driving.  In 2018, the NHTSA reported that 36,570 people died in automobile accidents, with another 400,000 being injured in collisions due to distracted driving.

<h1 id="teenagers">Teenagers</h1>

<p>Teenage drivers are almost 2x more likely to be involved in a distracted driving collision than an average driver.  They are generally less likely to realize the risk involved with distracted driving, as driving requires more attention than they realize.  As they have very little experience, the amount of attention is also increased even more, resulting in a higher percentage of crashes caused by teenage drivers.</p>

<p>The 2013 NHTSA study found that 14 out of every million licensed drivers involved in fatal distracted driving crashes were teenagers.  When looking at specifically teenagers, it was found that 24 out of every million teenage licensed drivers were involved in fatal distracted driving crashes. Out of all of the 3,154 distracted driving fatalities in 2013, 8 percent were teenagers between 15 and 19 years old, quite a large percentage for such a small group of drivers. Overall, 10 percent of all teenagers killed on the road died in distracted driving crashes, and 10 percent of all drivers responsible for distracted driving deaths were teenagers.</p>

<p>This data shows a clear issue with how teenagers are taught to drive.  Somewhere along the line, something falls apart and teens donâ€™t really get the memo that distracted driving is really bad.  Now, this could be contributed partially to parents who text or talk while driving, which is why I decided to do my capstone project.</p>
