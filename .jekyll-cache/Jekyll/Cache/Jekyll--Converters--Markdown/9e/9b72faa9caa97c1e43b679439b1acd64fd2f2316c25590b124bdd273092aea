<hr />
<p>Failing to complete this important task can result in serious injury or even death for the driver, their passengers, and anyone or thing else that is involved in the accident.  In the short moment that you may look away from the road, another vehicle can pull out in front of you, a pedestrian can suddenly step off the curb, or you can lose control of the vehicle. Distracted driving can be one of the costliest mistakes a person can make, even though it seems like such a small action.</p>

<p>For young drivers, it is especially important now for you to understand the dangers of distracted driving.  This allows you to train yourself to remain attentive while behind the wheel.  It is much easier to become distracted now than in the past, as modern vehicles possess many driver automation features that require less driver engagement, which allows the driver to become distracted much more easily.  Modern drivers are also a lot busier, more tired and stressed than drivers in the past.  All of this leads to the perfect conditions for a distracted driving accident.</p>

<p>Any activity that does not directly relate to driving can be considered a distraction. It does not matter how important you believe the task to be, it is not as important as driving and paying attention the road ahead of and around you.  Splitting your attention between driving and some other task greatly increases your chance of being in an accident.  No text or phone call is worth your life.</p>

<p>Control of a vehicle and knowledge of road rules are also useless when distracted driving.  It does not matter if you are a professional driver, if you are not paying attention there isn‚Äôt time to take evasive action in the event of an accident.  Even if you return your attention to the road with enough time to react, choices that may be good in one situation will make another situation worse, and there is no way for you to take in the full scene around you while making a decision before colliding with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, or other road blockage.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.epermittest.com/drivers-education/distracted-driving-being-attentive">Being attentive is a choice that drivers must actively make</a>.  Distractions will occur while driving, and you as the driver must choose to ignore the distractions and stay focused on the road. However, distractions that seem extra risky are often not the distractions that cause crashes.  Due to the perceived ‚Äúextra risk‚Äù, drivers will often try to pay attention to the road as much as possible while performing whatever action they wanted to.  More common distractions are generally more dangerous than a one-off distraction, as you don‚Äôt realize how long you are really looking away.  When texting, the average driver takes their eyes off the road for about 5 seconds.  That is  about the length of a football field if your car is travelling at 55mph (Risky Driving, 1). Some of the most common distractions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>üì± Texting</li>
  <li>üìû Talking on the phone</li>
  <li>üìª Listening to music</li>
  <li>üó∫Ô∏è Map reading</li>
  <li>ü•° Eating</li>
  <li>ü•§ Drinking</li>
</ul>

<p>Distractions that take up a lot of your time are also quite dangerous, as previously stated with texting and driving a whole football field while not looking at the road.</p>

<p>Forming attentive habits when someone is first starting to drive is extremely important.  When a new driver first starts driving, if they develop poor habits, they will be much harder to change later in life.  Many people have already developed these poor habits, so it is rather difficult for them to break that habit and adopt a much more attentive driving style.  My capstone project looks to help both new and old drivers stay attentive while driving using machine learning to keep them attentive.</p>
