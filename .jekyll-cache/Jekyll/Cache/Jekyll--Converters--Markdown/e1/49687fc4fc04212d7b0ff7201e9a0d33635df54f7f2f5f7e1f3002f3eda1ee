<hr />
<p>Failing to complete this important task can result in serious injury or even death for the driver, their passengers, and anyone or thing else that is involved in the accident.  In the short moment that you may look away from the road, another vehicle can pull out in front of you, a pedestrian can suddenly step off the curb, or you can lose control of the vehicle. Distracted driving can be one of the costliest mistakes a person can make, even though it seems like such a small action.</p>
